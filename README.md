Bacterial Aggregation Modelling - 
In this project the aggregation process of the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa was modelled using a modified version of the Smoluchowski coagulation equation. The results from the simulations were then compared to experimental data to test the accuracy of the model, and investigate the behaviour of the model under different growth rates.
